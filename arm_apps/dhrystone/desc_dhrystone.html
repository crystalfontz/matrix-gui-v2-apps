<h1> Dhrystone Benchmark Overview </h1>

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> The Dhrystone benchmark is intended to give a raw processor speed number indicating
how many dhrystones can be executed in one scecond. </p>
<h2> Additional Information </h2>
<p>- A static version of dhrystone compiled with Code Sourcery tools, version 
arm-2008q1 is  included in this SDK. Other compilers may achieve lesser 
performance<br>
- Dhrystone contains no floating point operations<br>
- Dhrystone is small enough to fit entirely into L1 cache<br></p>
<p>Input: (Number of Iterations) (CPU clock speed in KHz) <br>
Output: Dhrystones per Second / DMIPS/MHz </p>
